## Features

### Designed for extensibility

Primarily designed as a skeleton with 'hooks' to be supplied by the consumer of
this shell (e.g. can be site-specific or used by a theme that extends the
shell).

See [Extension (the hooks)][extension], below.

### Minimal theme in its own right

The skeleton has defaults for the 'hooks' that are sufficient to allow you to
use this project as a minimal theme for websites.

See [Usage][use], below.

### Classless or classful CSS supported

The HTML in the skeleton defaults to no classes on the elements by default,
but accepts parameters to override this behaviour (often can be site-wide or
per-page, or site-wide with page overrides, as you choose).

### Comes with sample 'responsive' vanilla CSS

1. Defaults to mobile menu as header until on larger screens
2. Includes a selection of starter colour schemes
3. Includes styles for reasonable printed output

## Usage

### Basic (as theme)

#### Hugo module (preferred)

1. Initialize the Hugo module system: `hugo mod init
	github.com/<your_user>/<your_project>`; (assuming you are using GitHub,
	of course).
2. Import the theme in your `hugo.toml`

	```ini
	[module]
	[[module.imports]]
	path = "github.com/wildtechgarden/wild-theme-shell-mod-hugo"
	```

3. Get the module

	```sh
	hugo mod get github.com/wildtechgarden/wild-theme-shell-mod-hugo
	```

4. To test the result, run the local Hugo server

	```sh
	hugo server -b http://localhost:1313/
	```

#### With `git submodule` (unsupported by theme author)

1. Make a themes directory and switch to it.

	```sh
	mkdir themes
	cd themes
	```

2. In the themes directory, add wild-theme-shell-mod-hugo as a submodule

	```sh
	git submodule add -f https://github.com/wildtechgarden/wild-theme-shell-mod-hugo.git
	```

3. Change back to the site directory
4. To test the result, run the local Hugo server

	```sh
	hugo server -t wild-theme-shell-mod-hugo -b http://localhost:1313/
	```

 Enjoy!
